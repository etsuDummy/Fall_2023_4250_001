Define Done:  Create requirements, create design document, and complete part of the implementation - minimal testing.

Requirements:

	Needs recursion

	Takes user input - 2 numbers (integer only)

	Validate the input, make sure the number is an integer and it is not outside the scope of the field.

	Take user input and add them together.

	Separate the last digit from the rest and add it to the remaining digits.

	Repeat until there is only 1 digit.


Design: Requirements Based design

	1 class

	2 methods, one for user input and one for recursion.

	Accept 1 int parameter for recursion method.

	Take in user input and validate the input.

	Use 2 booleans to validate user input.

	Output will be console based text.


Implementation:

	For our implementation, we encountered in our unit testing that:
		- In Recursion(), the program will repeat when the recursion method is called more than once
		- Recursion(), fix the digit count to be less than or equal to 1.
		-
