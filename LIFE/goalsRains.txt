Class Exercise 2

90 day goals (between now and end of semester in CSCI-4250): Make an A in Software Engineering I, 
Learn something new every day that it is possible regarding Software Engineering,
continue reading and re-reading both required and optional materials as that has been very beneficial,
continue researching (Googling) software engineering topics as they come up in reading materials or lecture, 
finding ways to implement things learned within this class in other classes and other aspects of life,
continually seek new ways to exceed expectations in Software Engineering I while also continuing to
exceed expectations in already-found ways.
